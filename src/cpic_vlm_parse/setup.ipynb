      "Table 1 Assignment of likely CYP2B6 phenotypes based on genotypes\n",
      "\n",
      "created to allow for the possibility that these may be clinically relevant for efavirenz or other CYP2B6 substrates, such as bupropion and methadone. See the CYP2B6 Diplotype-Phenotype Table1 for a complete list of possible diplotypes and phenotype assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic test interpretation\n",
      "\n",
      "Many clinical laboratories report CYP2B6 genotype results using the star-allele (*) nomenclature. The (*)-allele nomenclature for CYP2B6 alleles is found at the Pharmacogene Variation (PharmVar) Consortium website (https://www.pharmvar.org/ gene/CYP2B6). Some laboratories test and report only on specific SNPs that have been most extensively studied, such as c.516G>T and c.983T>C (rs28399499, p.1328T). These variants are the only defining SNPs for CYP2B6 * 9 and * 18, respectively, but c.983T>C is also found in combination with another variant in * 16, and c.516G>T is found in combination with other variants in 11 other CYP2B6 alleles (* 6, * 7, * 13, * 19, * 20, * 26, * 29, * 34, * 36, * 37, and * 38). In cases where only these two SNPs are tested, it is not possible to distinguish between the (*) alleles that contain these variants. However, all alleles that carry c.516G>T or c.983T>C are considered decreased function or no function alleles, respectively, and result in the same CYP2B6 phenotypes based on diplotypes. Tables on the CPIIC website contain a list of CYP2B6 alleles, the combinations of variants that define each allele, allele functional status, and allele frequency across major ancestral populations as reported in the literature.1\n",
      "\n",
      "The limitations of genetic testing, as described here, include: (i) known (*) alleles not tested for will not be reported, and instead, the allele will be reported as * 1 by default; (ii) in cases where only c.516G>T and/or c.983T>C variants are genotyped, it will not be known if they exist in combination with other variants, and the alleles may be reported as * 9 and * 18, respectively, by default (although this limitation should not affect efavirenz plasma exposure); (iii) rare variants may not be genotyped; (iv) tests are not designed to detect unknown or de novo variants; and (v) CYP2B6 structural variations exist (hybrids, duplications), but little is known of their frequencies and clinical relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Available genetic test options\n",
      "\n",
      "See the Genetic Testing Registry (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/) for more information on commercially available clinical testing options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incidental findings\n",
      "\n",
      "No diseases or conditions have been consistently or strongly linked with genetic variations in CYP2B6 independent of drug metabolism and response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "In a genomewide association study, CYP2B6 rs4803419 (g.15582C>T) was independently associated with increased plasma efavirenz exposure.4 Patients who were homozygous for the minor allele (g.15582T/T) had plasma efavirenz concentrations comparable to CYP2B6 intermediate metabolizers (IMs; based on CYP2B6 c.516G>T and c.983T>C status). This SNP is not defining for any particular (*) allele but is part of the CYP2B6 * 13 and * 15 haplotypes, and the CYP2B6 * 1C suballele as defined in PharmVar (https://www.pharmvar.org/gene/CYP2B6).\n",
      "\n",
      "Another CYP2B6 SNP, rs2279345 (g.18492T>C), has been associated with slightly decreased plasma efavirenz concentrations.5–9 This SNP is not part of any defined (*) alleles. The presence of this SNP together with coadministration of a strong CYP inducer may increase the likelihood of subtherapeutic plasma efavirenz concentrations.5\n",

      "Efavirenz is a nonnucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor that suppresses HIV-1 replication. For treatment-naive patients with HIV-positive disease, efavirenz in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine has been a cornerstone of treatment for >15 years based on its efficacy in randomized clinical trials, long half-life that allows for once-daily dosing, and availability of coformulation into a single tablet.
