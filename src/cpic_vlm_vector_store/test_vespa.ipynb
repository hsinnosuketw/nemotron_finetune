Haas13,16,*\\nThe HIV type-  1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase \\ninhibitor, efavirenz, is widely used to treat HIV type-1 \\ninfection. Efavirenz is predominantly metabolized into \\ninactive metabolites by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2B6, and \\npatients with certain CYP2B6  genetic variants may be \\nat increased risk for adverse effects, particularly central \\nnervous system toxicity and treatment discontinuation. We \\nsummarize the evidence from the literature and provide \\ntherapeutic recommendations for efavirenz prescribing \\nbased on CYP2B6 genotypes.\\nEfavirenz is a potent inhibitor of HIV type-  1 (HIV- 1) replica -\\ntion, with a relatively narrow therapeutic index and large interin -\\ndividual variability in pharmacokinetics, due in part to variants \\nin the cytochrome P450 (CYP)2B6 gene ( CYP2B6 ). The pur -\\npose of this guideline is to provide clinicians information that \\nwill allow the interpretation of clinical CYP2B6  genotype tests \\nso that the results can be used to guide efavirenz prescribing. \\nDetailed guidelines for use of efavirenz as well as cost effective -\\nness of CYP2B6  genotyping are beyond the scope of this docu -\\nment. Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium \\n(CPIC) guidelines are periodically updated at www.cpicp  gx.org/\\nguide  lines/ .\\nFOCUSED LITERATURE REVIEW\\nA systematic literature review focused on CYP2B6  genotype \\nand efavirenz use was conducted (details in Supplemental \\nMaterial ).\\nGene: CYP2B6\\nCYP2B6 is highly polymorphic with 38 known variant alleles and \\nmultiple suballeles (https  ://www.pharm var.org/gene/CYP2B6; \\nCYP2B6 Allele Definition Table 1). Substantial differences in al -\\nlele frequencies occur across ancestrally diverse groups ( CYP2B6 \\nFrequency Table1). Alleles are categorized into functional groups \\nas follows: normal function (e.g., CYP2B6*1 ), decreased function \\n(e.g., CYP2B6*6 and *9 ), no function (e.g., CYP2B6*18 ), and in-\\ncreased function (e.g., CYP2B6*4 ). Allele function assignments, \\nas described in the CYP2B6  Allele Functionality Table 1, have \\nbeen made based on in vitro  data with or without in vivo  data. \\nCYP2B6*6 (p.Q172H, p.K262R) is the most frequently decreased \\nfunction allele (15–60% minor allele frequency depending on an -\\ncestry) and has been studied most extensively. Although reduced \\nprotein expression due to aberrant splicing caused by the c.516G> T \\n(rs3745274, p.Q172H) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) \\ncontributes to reduced function of CYP2B6*6 ,\\n2 in vitro  studies \\nalso suggest complex substrate-  dependent catalytic effects (re -\\nviewed in ref. 3). Therefore, it is somewhat challenging to assign \\nfunction to CYP2B6 alleles, as function may be substrate- specific.\\nThe combination of inherited alleles determines a person’s \\ndiplotype. T able\\xa01 defines each phenotype based on genotype and \\nprovides examples of diplotypes. Evidence based on few patients \\nsuggests that the CYP2B6*4 and *22 alleles are associated with \\nmodestly reduced plasma efavirenz exposure. Thus, CYP2B6*4  \\nand *22 are categorized as increased function alleles. The pheno -\\ntype categories of CYP2B6 rapid metabolizer (RM; one normal \\nfunction allele and one increased function allele) and CYP2B6 \\nultrarapid metabolizer (UM; two increased function alleles) were \\nReceived January 14, 2019; accepted April 12, 2019. doi:10.1002/cpt.1477\\n1Department of Medicine,\\xa0Division of Clinical Pharmacology,\\xa0Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA; 2Department \\nof Pharmacy Practice,\\xa0Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences University School of Pharmacy, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; \\n3Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences,\\xa0St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA; 4Department of Biomedical Data \\nScience,\\xa0Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA; 5Department of Infectious Diseases,\\xa0St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, \\nTennessee, USA; 6Division of Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine,\\xa0Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital,\\xa0Department of \\nPathology,\\xa0Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; 7Laboratory for Pharmacogenomics,\\xa0Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital,\\xa0Somdech Phra \\nDebaratana Medical Center, Bangkok, Thailand; 8Department of Pharmacy and Genomic Medicine Institute,\\xa0Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA; \\n9Department of Diagnostic & Biomedical Sciences,\\xa0The University of Texas Health Sciences Center School of Dentistry, Houston, Texas, USA; 10Centre \\nfor Addiction and Mental Health,\\xa0University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; 11African Institute of Biomedical Science & Technology,\\xa0Wilkins \\nHospital, Harare, Zimbabwe; 12Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences,\\xa0Fairleigh Dickinson University School of Pharmacy, Florham Park, New Jersey, USA; \\n13Department of Internal Medicine,\\xa0Meharry Medical College School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA; 14Division of Infectious Diseases,\\xa0Emory \\nUniversity School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA; 15Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Toxicology, & Therapeutic Innovation,\\xa0Children’s Mercy \\nKansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, USA; 16Departments of Medicine, Pharmacology, Pathology, Microbiology, & Immunology,\\xa0Vanderbilt University \\nSchool of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA. *Correspondence: David W.

See the CYP2B6 Diplotype- Phenotype Table1 for \\na complete list of possible diplotypes and phenotype assignments.\\nGenetic test interpretation\\nMany clinical laboratories report CYP2B6  genotype results \\nusing the star-  allele (*) nomenclature. The (*)-  allele nomencla -\\nture for CYP2B6  alleles is found at the Pharmacogene Variation \\n(PharmVar) Consortium website (https  ://www.pharm var.org/\\ngene/CYP2B6). Some laboratories test and report only on \\nspecific SNPs that have been most extensively studied, such as \\nc.516G> T and c.983T>C (rs28399499, p.I328T). These variants \\nare the only defining SNPs for CYP2B6*9  and *18, respectively, \\nbut c.983T>C is also found in combination with another variant \\nin *16, and c.516G> T is found in combination with other vari -\\nants in 11 other CYP2B6  alleles (*6 , *7, *13, *19, *20, *26, *29, \\n*34, *36, *37, and *38 ). In cases where only these two SNPs are \\ntested, it is not possible to distinguish between the (*) alleles that \\ncontain these variants. However, all alleles that carry c.516G> T \\nor c.983T>C are considered decreased function or no function \\nalleles, respectively, and result in the same CYP2B6 phenotypes \\nbased on diplotypes. Tables on the CPIC website contain a list \\nof CYP2B6  alleles, the combinations of variants that define each \\nallele, allele functional status, and allele frequency across major \\nancestral populations as reported in the literature.\\n1\\nThe limitations of genetic testing, as described here, include: \\n(i) known (*) alleles not tested for will not be reported, and in -\\nstead, the allele will be reported as *1 by default; (ii) in cases where \\nonly c.516G>T and/or c.983T>C variants are genotyped, it will \\nnot be known if they exist in combination with other variants, \\nand the alleles may be reported as *9 and *18, respectively, by de -\\nfault (although this limitation should not affect efavirenz plasma \\nexposure); (iii) rare variants may not be genotyped; (iv)\\xa0 tests \\nare not designed to detect unknown or de novo variants; and  \\n(v) CYP2B6 structural variations exist (hybrids, duplications), \\nbut little is known of their frequencies and clinical relevance.\\nAvailable genetic test options\\nSee the Genetic Testing Registry (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/) \\nfor more information on commercially available clinical testing \\noptions.\\nIncidental findings\\nNo diseases or conditions have been consistently or strongly \\nlinked with genetic variations in CYP2B6  independent of drug \\nmetabolism and response.\\nOther considerations\\nIn a genomewide association study, CYP2B6  rs4803419 \\n(g.15582C> T) was independently associated with increased \\nplasma efavirenz exposure.\\n4 Patients who were homozygous for \\nthe minor allele (g.15582T/T) had plasma efavirenz concentra -\\ntions comparable to CYP2B6 intermediate metabolizers (IMs; \\nbased on CYP2B6  c.516G> T and c.983T>C status).

Other CYP \\nenzymes, including CYP2A6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2, play \\nminor roles in efavirenz 8-  hydroxylation. CYP2A6-  mediated \\nhydroxylation to 7-  hydroxy- efavirenz and UGT2B7-  mediated \\nglucuronidation to efavirenz N-  glucuronide are minor meta -\\nbolic pathways, although these enzymes may play a larger role in \\nCYP2B6 poor metabolizers (PMs). The hydroxylated metabo -\\nlites of efavirenz undergo conjugation via glucuronidation and/\\nor sulfation and are subsequently excreted in urine. Details of \\nefavirenz metabolic pathways are provided at the PharmGKB \\nwebsite and in Figure\\xa01.\\n12,14 The contribution of these pathways \\nmay differ following a single dose of efavirenz vs. chronic dos-\\ning. Efavirenz increases CYP2B6 expression via activation of the \\nconstitutive androstane receptor.\\n15 As a result, chronic dosing \\nof efavirenz enhances its own metabolism (“auto-  induction”). \\nThe magnitude of efavirenz auto-  induction varies among in -\\ndividuals and is, in part, affected by variations in the CYP2B6  \\ngene. For example, there is considerable CYP2B6 induction \\nwith the CYP2B6*1/*1 and *1/*6 genotypes but little or no \\nauto- induction with CYP2B6*6/*6. 16 Relationships between \\nCYP2B6 genotype and apparent oral clearance for efavirenz are \\nshown in Figure  S1.\\nTherapeutic drug monitoring may be used in some situations \\nto ensure adequate plasma efavirenz concentrations. A therapeu -\\ntic range for plasma efavirenz concentrations of 1–4\\xa0 μg/mL has \\nbeen suggested,\\n17 although concentrations somewhat <1\\xa0 μg/mL \\ndo not consistently predict treatment failure, and concentrations \\n>\\xa04\\xa0 μg/mL do not consistently predict toxicity. In one observa -\\ntional cohort study, virologic failure was observed in 50% of pa -\\ntients with plasma efavirenz concentrations <\\xa01\\xa0 μg/mL (which \\nmay have reflected nonadherence in some patients) as compared \\nto 22% and 18% of patients with concentrations between 1 and \\n4\\xa0 μg/mL and >4\\xa0 μg/mL, respectively. CNS side effects were \\nobserved in 24%, 9%, and 0% of patients with plasma efavirenz \\nconcentrations of >4\\xa0 μg/mL, 1–4\\xa0 μg/mL, and <1\\xa0 μg/mL, re -\\nspectively.\\n17 CNS side effects may manifest as disordered sleep, \\nimpaired concentration, psychosis, suicidal ideation, and depres-\\nsion. Such effects typically manifest within the first few days of \\ntreatment initiation and largely resolve with continued dosing. \\nHowever, symptoms may persist in some patients, impacting \\nquality of life and resulting in treatment discontinuation. T o \\nminimize CNS adverse effects during waking hours, efavirenz is \\ntypically taken at bedtime.\\nLinking genetic variability to variability in drug-  related \\nphenotypes\\nSubstantial evidence links CYP2B6  genotype with variability \\nin plasma efavirenz concentrations and with adverse effects. \\nMost studies have examined the impact of CYP2B6  c . 516 G >T  \\nand c.983T>C; therefore, these variants provide the basis for \\nour clinical recommendations. As outlined in Table S1 , the \\nevidence associating these two variants with increased plasma \\nefavirenz concentrations was strong. Multiple studies have \\nshown that the CYP2B6  PM genotype, particularly defined \\nby homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for CYP2B6  \\nc.516G> T and/or c.983T>C, is associated with decreased efa -\\nvirenz clearance ( Figure  S1) and increased risk for efavirenz \\ntoxicity (particularly CNS toxicity, hepatic injury,\\n18 and  \\ncorrected QT prolongation 19) and/or treatment discontinu -\\nation, although some studies have not shown such an associ -\\nation. Such associations seem to vary with race/ethnicity. For \\nother CYP2B6  alleles that are associated with interindividual \\nvariability in plasma efavirenz concentrations (e.g., CYP2B6*4 , \\n*22 , and g.15582C> T), associations have not been demon -\\nstrated with reduced efficacy, increased toxicity, or treatment \\ndiscontinuation, perhaps because these alleles are either infre -\\nquent or have modest effects on plasma efavirenz exposure.\\nTherapeutic recommendations\\nCYP2B6 - guided efavirenz dosing, particularly in the presence \\nof CYP2B6 c.516G> T, has been shown in clinical studies to be \\nassociated with therapeutic plasma efavirenz concentrations and \\ndecreased CNS toxicity, while maintaining virologic efficacy (see \\nTable S1). Table\\xa0 2 summarizes therapeutic recommendations \\nfor efavirenz prescribing in adults based on CYP2B6 phenotype. \\nThese recommendations also apply to children weighing >40\\xa0kg, \\nas adult dosing applies to this group. Based on current evidence \\n(Table S1), CYP2B6 normal metabolizers (NMs) are expected \\nto have normal efavirenz metabolism and achieve therapeutic \\nefavirenz concentrations with standard dosing (600\\xa0 mg/day). \\nCYP2B6 IMs may experience higher dose-  adjusted trough con -\\ncentrations compared with NMs, which may put these patients up \\nto a 1.3-  fold increased risk of adverse effects.\\n20–25 For these pa -\\ntients, there is a “moderate” recommendation to consider initiat -\\ning efavirenz with a decreased dose of 400\\xa0mg/day. CYP2B6 PMs \\nare at greatest risk for higher dose-  adjusted trough concentrations \\ncompared with NMs and IMs, and greater overall plasma efavirenz \\nexposure, which puts these patients up to a 4.8-  fold increased risk \\nfor adverse effects and treatment discontinuation. 20–31 For these \\npatients, there is a “moderate” recommendation to consider initi -\\nating efavirenz with a decreased dose of either 400 or 200\\xa0mg/day. \\nThis “moderate” rather than “strong” recommendation reflects \\nthe fact that most CYP2B6 PMs do not discontinue efavirenz \\n600\\xa0 mg/day for adverse effects. Dose reduction to 400\\xa0 mg/day \\nmay be feasible without increasing pill burden because, in 2018, \\nthe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a generic \\ncoformulated product consisting of efavirenz (400\\xa0 mg), lamivu -\\ndine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. There is currently no co -\\nformulated tablet with 200\\xa0mg efavirenz, so decreasing the dose to \\n200\\xa0mg/day may be complicated by increased pill burden. If thera-\\npeutic drug monitoring is available and a decreased efavirenz dose \\nis prescribed, steady- state plasma efavirenz concentrations may be \\nobtained to ensure therapeutic concentrations (~\\xa0 1–4\\xa0 μg/mL). \\nAmong CYP2B6 IMs and PMs, prescribing efavirenz at 400\\xa0mg/\\nday will almost certainly not reduce virologic efficacy, based on \\nresults of the ENCORE study in which treatment-  naive patients \\nwere randomized to initiate efavirenz-  based regimens (com -\\nbined with tenofovir and emtricitabine) at either 600\\xa0mg/day or ',\n",

However, based \\non current evidence, the effect of the increased function alleles \\nCYP2B6*4 and *22 seems to be modest.\\n27,33–35 As such, current \\ndata are not sufficient to recommend a change from normal pre -\\nscribing at this time, and patients with the RM or UM pheno -\\ntype should receive standard efavirenz dosing. Of note, to define \\nCYP2B6*4 requires documenting the absence of c.516G>T.\\nPediatrics. Efavirenz is FDA-  approved for use as part of \\nantiretroviral therapy in children ≥3\\xa0months of age and weighing \\n≥3.5\\xa0 kg. In the United States, efavirenz is available as capsules \\n(50 or 200\\xa0 mg); tablets (600\\xa0 mg); a fixed-dose combination \\ncomprised of efavirenz 600\\xa0 mg, emtricitabine 200\\xa0 mg, and \\ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300\\xa0mg and more recently a fixed \\ndose combination called Symfi Lo (efavirenz 400\\xa0mg, lamivudine \\n300\\xa0mg, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300\\xa0mg) for children \\nweighing ≥35\\xa0 kg. The US Department of Health and Human \\nServices (DHHS) Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents \\nin Pediatric HIV Infection recommends efavirenz in combination \\nwith two-  nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors as an \\nalternative nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor regimen \\nfor initial treatment of HIV in children aged ≥\\xa03\\xa0years.\\n36\\nChildren aged <3\\xa0 years.  Determining the optimal efavirenz \\ndose for children <3\\xa0 years of age or weighing <10\\xa0 kg has been \\nparticularly challenging, as pharmacokinetic studies have shown \\na greater effect of genotype on efavirenz metabolism in young \\nchildren due to high apparent clearance rates, especially among \\nNMs.\\n37 In this population, as with adults ( Figure S1), the \\napparent clearance was reduced by 19% and 57% with CYP2B6  \\nc.516G/T and c.516T/T genotypes, respectively, compared to \\nc.516G/G.

       " 'CPIC GUIDELINE\\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS | VOLUME 106 NUMBER 4 | OCTOBER 2019 731\\nby IMPAACT study P1070. 36 The guidelines recommended an \\nefavirenz dose reduction based on weight groups for CYP2B6 \\nPMs (c.516T/T): 5\\xa0kg to <7\\xa0kg: 50\\xa0mg; 7\\xa0kg to <14\\xa0kg: 100\\xa0mg; \\n14\\xa0kg to <17\\xa0kg: 150\\xa0mg; and ≥17\\xa0kg: 150\\xa0mg. Dosing for NMs \\n(c.516G/G) and IMs (c.516G/T) is as follows: 5\\xa0 kg to <7\\xa0 kg: \\n300\\xa0 mg; 7\\xa0 kg to <14\\xa0 kg: 400\\xa0 mg; 14\\xa0 kg to <17\\xa0 kg: 500\\xa0 mg; \\nand ≥17\\xa0 kg: 600\\xa0 mg. Although current DHHS guidelines for \\nefavirenz dosing in pediatrics do not consider c.983T>C, we \\nrecommend that dosing recommendations for c.516T/T also be \\napplied to c.516T/c.983C and to c.983C/C. We also recommend \\nmeasuring plasma efavirenz concentrations 2\\xa0 weeks after \\ninitiation. The mid-  dose plasma efavirenz concentration target of \\n1–4\\xa0mg/L derived from adult clinical monitoring data is typically \\nalso applied to trough concentrations in pediatric patients.\\nChildren age >\\xa03\\xa0years and weighing <\\xa040\\xa0kg. Although the effect of \\nCYP2B6  genotype on efavirenz exposure has been demonstrated \\nin children older than 3\\xa0years of age who weigh <\\xa040\\xa0kg, specific \\nclinical data supporting CYP2B6  genotype-  guided dosing are \\nlimited. Thus, although we cannot make a firm recommendation \\nfor dose adjustment based on CYP2B6  genotype in this age \\nand weight group, CYP2B6  genotype almost certainly affects \\nefavirenz exposure in these children such that efavirenz dose \\nreduction in CYP2B6 PMs would also be reasonable. Therapeutic \\ndrug monitoring, where available and accessible, could help \\nguide dosing adjustments in this age/weight group, especially in \\na setting of potential drug-  related toxicity, virologic rebound, or \\nlack of response in an adherent patient. For pediatric patients who \\nweigh 40\\xa0kg or more, adult dosing applies (see Table  2).\\nRecommendations for incidental findings\\nNot applicable.\\nOther considerations\\nCYP2B6 rs4803419 (g.15582 C>T) . In a study involving 856 \\nparticipants from several prospective clinical trials, and after \\ncontrolling for both CYP2B6 c.516G> T and c.983T>C, increased \\nplasma efavirenz concentrations were associated with CYP2B6  \\ng . 155 8 2 C >T  (P\\xa0= \\xa04 . 4 \\xa0× \\xa01 0\\n−15).4 Other studies have not yet \\nreplicated this association for efavirenz, either because individual \\nstudies did not genotype this SNP or because this SNP was \\ninfrequent in small studies of primarily African cohorts.\\nImplementation of this guideline.  The guideline supplement and \\nCPIC website (https  ://cpicp gx.org/guide lines/ cpic-guide line-for-\\nefavi renz-based-on-cyp2b6-genot  ype/) contains resources that \\ncan be used within electronic health records to assist clinicians \\nin applying genetic information to patient care for the purpose \\nof drug therapy optimization (see Resources to incorporate \\npharmacogenetics into an electronic health record with clinical \\ndecision support in the Supplemental Material ).\\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS AND RISKS FOR THE PATIENT\\nThe potential benefit of using CYP2B6 genotype data to guide efa-\\nvirenz therapy is that patients with genotypes that predict higher \\ndose- adjusted plasma exposure and adverse effects may be identified \\nand prescribed a decreased dose that will decrease the likelihood of \\ntoxicity and treatment discontinuation while still achieving thera-\\npeutic plasma efavirenz concentrations. Risks include the potential \\nfor subtherapeutic plasma efavirenz concentrations and treatment \\nfailure. As with any laboratory test, a possible risk to patients is \\nan error in genotyping or phenotype prediction, which could have \\nlong- term adverse health implications for patients.\\nCAVEATS: APPROPRIATE USE AND/OR POTENTIAL MISUSE \\nOF GENETIC TESTS\\nRare CYP2B6 variants may not be included in the genotype test \\nused, and patients with rare variants may be assigned an NM \\nphenotype ( CYP2B6*1/*1) by default. Thus, an assigned *1  al -\\nlele could potentially harbor a decreased or no-function variant. \\nTherefore, it is important that test reports include information on \\nwhich variant alleles were genotyped.\\nAs with any diagnostic test, CYP2B6 genotype is just one fac-\\ntor that clinicians should consider when prescribing efavirenz. It \\nis important to consider that efavirenz is typically coformulated \\nin a fixed-  dose combination tablet, which allows for one pill, \\nonce- daily dosing. If 400\\xa0mg or 200\\xa0mg doses of efavirenz are un -\\navailable in a fixed-  dose combination tablet, dose reduction may \\nrequire prescribing two or three tablets daily, which not only in -\\ncreases pill burden but also risk for nonadherence and virologic \\nfailure with drug-  resistant viruses. Another consideration is the \\nimpact of drug– drug interactions. For example, if coadministered \\nwith drugs that lower plasma efavirenz exposure (e.g., carbamaz-\\nepine, phenytoin, and rifampin without isoniazid), it may be \\nprudent to not further reduce efavirenz dose based on genotype. \\nAlthough pregnancy does not substantially affect plasma efavirenz \\nexposure,\\n40 clinical judgment should be exercised if genotype-  \\ninformed dose reduction is considered during pregnancy.\\nSUPPORTING INFORMATION\\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper on the Clinical \\nPharmacology & Therapeutics website (www.cpt-journal.com).\\nSupplemental Material.
